    <h1>Customer Discovery Interviews: How to Ask Questions That Actually Matter</h1>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> Entrepreneurship<br />
<strong>Reading Time:</strong> 8 minutes<br />
<strong>Excerpt:</strong> Most founders ask the wrong questions and get misleading answers. Here's how to conduct customer discovery interviews that reveal truth.</p>
<p><em>By Diana Lee | Enterprise Educator</em></p>
<hr />
<h2>Why Most Customer Interviews Fail</h2>
<p><strong>Common founder mistake:</strong><br />
"Would you use an app that helps you manage your tasks better?"</p>
<p><strong>Customer response:</strong><br />
"Yeah, that sounds great!"</p>
<p><strong>What happens next:</strong><br />
You build it. No one uses it.</p>
<p><strong>What went wrong?</strong> You asked about hypothetical future behaviour, not actual past behaviour. People are terrible at predicting what they'll do.</p>
<hr />
<h2>The Golden Rule of Customer Discovery</h2>
<p><strong>Talk about their life, not your idea.</strong></p>
<p>Your goal isn't to validate your solution. It's to deeply understand their problem.</p>
<h3><strong>Bad Interview Mindset:</strong></h3>
<p>"I need to convince them my idea is good"</p>
<h3><strong>Good Interview Mindset:</strong></h3>
<p>"I need to understand if the problem I think exists actually exists"</p>
<p><strong>The shift:</strong> From pitching to learning.</p>
<hr />
<h2>The Mom Test Framework</h2>
<p><strong>Based on Rob Fitzpatrick's book "The Mom Test"</strong></p>
<p><strong>The principle:</strong> Ask questions that even your mum couldn't lie to you about.</p>
<h3><strong>The Three Rules:</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Talk about their life, not your idea</strong></li>
<li><strong>Ask about specifics in the past, not generics or opinions about the future</strong></li>
<li><strong>Talk less, listen more</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Let's break these down.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Rule 1: Talk About Their Life (Not Your Idea)</h2>
<h3><strong>❌ DON'T Say:</strong></h3>
<p>"I'm building an app for freelancers to track time. Would you use it?"</p>
<p><strong>Why it fails:</strong><br />
- Puts them in "be nice" mode<br />
- Asks them to imagine the future (they're bad at this)<br />
- You get polite lies</p>
<h3><strong>✅ DO Say:</strong></h3>
<p>"How do you currently track time for client projects?"</p>
<p><strong>Why it works:</strong><br />
- Asks about real behaviour<br />
- Reveals actual pain points<br />
- Gets honest answers</p>
<p><strong>Follow-up questions:</strong><br />
- "What's frustrating about that process?"<br />
- "How much time does it take you?"<br />
- "Have you tried other solutions?"<br />
- "What didn't work about them?"</p>
<hr />
<h2>Rule 2: Ask About the Past (Not the Future)</h2>
<p><strong>People are terrible at predicting their behaviour.</strong></p>
<h3><strong>❌ DON'T Ask:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>"Would you buy this?"</li>
<li>"How much would you pay?"</li>
<li>"Would you switch from your current solution?"</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why these fail:</strong> Hypothetical questions get hypothetical answers ("Yeah, probably!" doesn't mean they'll actually buy).</p>
<h3><strong>✅ DO Ask:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>"Tell me about the last time this problem happened"</li>
<li>"What did you do when that happened?"</li>
<li>"Have you looked for solutions to this before?"</li>
<li>"What have you tried that didn't work?"</li>
<li>"How much are you currently spending on this problem?"</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The difference:</strong> Past behaviour predicts future behaviour. Stated intentions don't.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Rule 3: Talk Less, Listen More</h2>
<p><strong>Your ideal talk-to-listen ratio: 20/80</strong></p>
<p><strong>You talk 20%:</strong> Asking questions<br />
<strong>You listen 80%:</strong> Understanding their world</p>
<h3><strong>Signs You're Talking Too Much:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>You're explaining features</li>
<li>You're defending your idea</li>
<li>You're steering the conversation</li>
<li>You're excited about their validation</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>How to Listen Better:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Ask open questions</li>
<li>Embrace awkward silences (they fill them with insights)</li>
<li>Take notes (or record with permission)</li>
<li>Follow their tangents (often where gold is hidden)</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Customer Discovery Interview Script</h2>
<h3><strong>Phase 1: Context Setting (5 minutes)</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Your intro:</strong><br />
"Thanks for meeting with me. I'm researching [problem area] and would love to learn about your experience. I'm NOT selling anything today—I genuinely want to understand how you currently handle [problem]. Is that okay?"</p>
<p><strong>Why this works:</strong><br />
- Takes pressure off them<br />
- Removes "sales mode"<br />
- Gets honest answers</p>
<p><strong>Opening question:</strong><br />
"Can you walk me through your current process for [activity related to problem]?"</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Phase 2: Problem Exploration (15-20 minutes)</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Uncover the pain:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Question set 1: Current state</strong><br />
- "How do you currently handle [problem]?"<br />
- "How long does that typically take?"<br />
- "Who else is involved in the process?"</p>
<p><strong>Question set 2: Pain points</strong><br />
- "What's frustrating about the way you do this now?"<br />
- "Tell me about a recent time when this was particularly painful"<br />
- "If you could wave a magic wand, what would change?"</p>
<p><strong>Question set 3: Workarounds</strong><br />
- "Have you tried to solve this before?"<br />
- "What solutions have you looked at?"<br />
- "What did you try that didn't work?"<br />
- "Why didn't that work?"</p>
<p><strong>Question set 4: Impact</strong><br />
- "How much does this problem cost you?" (time/money/stress)<br />
- "What happens if you don't solve this?"<br />
- "Is this a top-3 problem for you right now?"</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Phase 3: Solution Discovery (10 minutes)</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Only if the problem is validated, gently explore solutions:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Still don't pitch. Explore:</strong><br />
- "If there was a solution to this, what would it need to do?"<br />
- "What would make you switch from your current approach?"<br />
- "What concerns would you have about changing?"</p>
<p><strong>Critical question:</strong><br />
"If I could solve this problem perfectly, is it something you'd be willing to pay for?"</p>
<p><strong>If yes:</strong><br />
"What are you currently spending on this problem?" (reveals real budget)</p>
<p><strong>If no:</strong><br />
"Help me understand why not" (reveals it's not painful enough)</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Phase 4: Next Steps (5 minutes)</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Ask for commitments (not compliments):</strong></p>
<p><strong>❌ DON'T Ask:</strong><br />
"What do you think of this idea?"</p>
<p><strong>✅ DO Ask:</strong><br />
- "Can I show you a rough prototype when I have one?"<br />
- "Would you be willing to beta test this?"<br />
- "Can you introduce me to others who have this problem?"</p>
<p><strong>Real interest = willingness to commit time/attention.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Thank them:</strong><br />
"This has been incredibly helpful. Can I follow up if I have questions?"</p>
<hr />
<h2>The Questions You're Afraid to Ask (But Should)</h2>
<h3><strong>1. "Why haven't you solved this already?"</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Reveals:</strong> Whether the problem is painful enough to warrant a solution</p>
<h3><strong>2. "What else have you tried that failed?"</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Reveals:</strong> The competitive landscape and why existing solutions don't work</p>
<h3><strong>3. "Is this a top-3 priority for you right now?"</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Reveals:</strong> Whether they'll actually use/buy your solution (or just think it's "nice to have")</p>
<h3><strong>4. "Can you introduce me to others with this problem?"</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Reveals:</strong> Whether they're truly engaged (real interest = willingness to help)</p>
<hr />
<h2>Red Flags in Customer Discovery</h2>
<p><strong>Watch out for these responses:</strong></p>
<h3><strong>🚩 "That sounds really interesting!"</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Translation:</strong> "I'm being polite"<br />
<strong>What to do:</strong> Dig deeper into their actual behaviour</p>
<h3><strong>🚩 "I might use that someday"</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Translation:</strong> "This isn't urgent for me"<br />
<strong>What to do:</strong> Find out what IS urgent</p>
<h3><strong>🚩 "I think you should add [feature X, Y, Z]"</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Translation:</strong> They're designing your product for you<br />
<strong>What to do:</strong> Ask why they need that feature. What problem does it solve?</p>
<h3><strong>🚩 "That's a good idea, you should talk to [other person]"</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Translation:</strong> This isn't their problem<br />
<strong>What to do:</strong> Thank them and move on</p>
<h3><strong>🚩 Vague answers without specific examples</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Translation:</strong> They're hypothesising, not remembering<br />
<strong>What to do:</strong> "Can you tell me about the last specific time this happened?"</p>
<hr />
<h2>Green Flags (You're Onto Something)</h2>
<p><strong>Positive signals:</strong></p>
<p>✅ <strong>They get animated when describing the problem</strong><br />
<strong>Means:</strong> This is a real, painful problem</p>
<p>✅ <strong>They describe specific, recent instances</strong><br />
<strong>Means:</strong> This happens frequently</p>
<p>✅ <strong>They've tried multiple solutions that failed</strong><br />
<strong>Means:</strong> They're actively seeking a solution</p>
<p>✅ <strong>They're currently spending money/time on workarounds</strong><br />
<strong>Means:</strong> They have budget for a better solution</p>
<p>✅ <strong>They ask when they can use what you're building</strong><br />
<strong>Means:</strong> Real urgency</p>
<p>✅ <strong>They offer to introduce you to others</strong><br />
<strong>Means:</strong> Genuine engagement</p>
<hr />
<h2>How Many Interviews Do You Need?</h2>
<p><strong>Minimum:</strong> 15-20 problem interviews before building anything</p>
<p><strong>Why this many:</strong><br />
- First 5: You're learning to ask good questions<br />
- Next 10: You're discovering patterns<br />
- After 15: You start hearing the same things (diminishing returns)</p>
<p><strong>Keep going until:</strong><br />
- You stop hearing new information<br />
- Clear patterns emerge<br />
- You can predict what interviewees will say</p>
<p><strong>Then (and only then):</strong> Build a solution.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Common Mistakes (and How to Fix Them)</h2>
<h3><strong>Mistake 1: Pitching Your Idea</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Fix:</strong> Pretend you haven't built anything yet (even if you have)</p>
<h3><strong>Mistake 2: Asking Leading Questions</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Fix:</strong> Make questions neutral ("How do you currently handle X?" not "Isn't it frustrating how you handle X?")</p>
<h3><strong>Mistake 3: Interviewing Friends/Family</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Fix:</strong> Find your actual target customer (friends are biased)</p>
<h3><strong>Mistake 4: Seeking Validation</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Fix:</strong> Seek truth. You want to know if you're wrong NOW, not after you've built it</p>
<h3><strong>Mistake 5: Not Taking Notes</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Fix:</strong> Write everything down or record (with permission)</p>
<hr />
<h2>After the Interviews: Making Sense of Data</h2>
<h3><strong>Look for Patterns:</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Create a spreadsheet:</strong></p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Interviewee</th>
<th>Problem Frequency</th>
<th>Pain Level (1-10)</th>
<th>Current Solution</th>
<th>Willing to Pay?</th>
<th>Top Priority?</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Person 1</td>
<td>Daily</td>
<td>8</td>
<td>Spreadsheets</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>Yes</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Person 2</td>
<td>Weekly</td>
<td>5</td>
<td>Nothing</td>
<td>Maybe</td>
<td>No</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><strong>Analyse:</strong><br />
- What problems come up repeatedly?<br />
- Who experiences the most pain?<br />
- What solutions have failed?<br />
- Who's willing to pay?</p>
<p><strong>Decision criteria:</strong><br />
- <strong>Build:</strong> Problem is urgent, frequent, expensive, top-3 priority<br />
- <strong>Pivot:</strong> Problem exists but isn't urgent enough<br />
- <strong>Stop:</strong> No consistent problem pattern</p>
<hr />

<hr />
<h2>Final Thought</h2>
<p><strong>Most startups fail because they build something nobody wants.</strong></p>
<p>Customer discovery interviews are your insurance policy against this.</p>
<p>Ask the right questions. Listen deeply. Build what people actually need.</p>
