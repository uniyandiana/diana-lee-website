<strong>Excerpt:</strong> Understanding imposter syndrome through a psychological lens and practical strategies to overcome self-doubt in your career.</p>
<p><em>By Diana Lee | Career Development Facilitator</em></p>
<hr />
<h2>What is Imposter Syndrome?</h2>
<p>You've landed the promotion. You're excelling at work. People respect your expertise. Yet internally, you're convinced you're a fraud who's somehow fooled everyone.</p>
<p>Welcome to imposter syndrome—a psychological pattern where individuals doubt their accomplishments and fear being exposed as a "fraud," despite evidence of their competence.</p>
<p><strong>The surprising truth:</strong> It affects up to 70% of people at some point in their careers, and it's particularly common among high achievers.</p>
<hr />
<h2>The Psychology Behind Imposter Feelings</h2>
<h3>1. <strong>Attribution Errors</strong></h3>
<p><strong>The pattern:</strong><br />
- Success → "I got lucky" or "The task was easy"<br />
- Failure → "I'm not good enough"</p>
<p><strong>The reality:</strong> You're attributing success to external factors while internalising failure. This cognitive distortion maintains the imposter cycle.</p>
<h3>2. <strong>Perfectionism</strong></h3>
<p><strong>The connection:</strong><br />
- Setting impossibly high standards<br />
- Anything less than perfect = failure<br />
- Success never feels "good enough"</p>
<p><strong>The cost:</strong> Chronic stress, procrastination, and inability to celebrate wins.</p>
<h3>3. <strong>The Expert Trap</strong></h3>
<p><strong>The paradox:</strong> The more you learn, the more you realise how much you don't know.</p>
<p>This is called the <strong>Dunning-Kruger effect</strong> in reverse—competent people underestimate their abilities whilst beginners overestimate theirs.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Five Types of Imposter Syndrome</h2>
<p>Based on research by Dr. Valerie Young:</p>
<h3>1. <strong>The Perfectionist</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Belief:</strong> "If it's not perfect, I've failed"</li>
<li><strong>Trigger:</strong> Making any mistake</li>
<li><strong>Cost:</strong> Procrastination, burnout, inability to delegate</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. <strong>The Superhuman</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Belief:</strong> "I must excel in ALL roles"</li>
<li><strong>Trigger:</strong> Not being the best at everything</li>
<li><strong>Cost:</strong> Overwork, relationship strain, burnout</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. <strong>The Natural Genius</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Belief:</strong> "If I struggle, I'm not smart enough"</li>
<li><strong>Trigger:</strong> Having to work hard at something</li>
<li><strong>Cost:</strong> Avoiding challenges, fragile confidence</li>
</ul>
<h3>4. <strong>The Soloist</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Belief:</strong> "Asking for help proves I'm a fraud"</li>
<li><strong>Trigger:</strong> Needing assistance or collaboration</li>
<li><strong>Cost:</strong> Isolation, missed opportunities, slower growth</li>
</ul>
<h3>5. <strong>The Expert</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Belief:</strong> "I need to know everything before I start"</li>
<li><strong>Trigger:</strong> Being asked something they don't know</li>
<li><strong>Cost:</strong> Analysis paralysis, missed opportunities</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Which one resonates with you?</strong> Most people identify with 1-2 types.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Why It Persists (Even When You Know Better)</h2>
<h3><strong>The Confirmation Bias Loop</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li>You feel like a fraud</li>
<li>You work extra hard to compensate</li>
<li>You succeed</li>
<li>You attribute success to extra effort, not ability</li>
<li>You feel like a fraud (because "anyone could do it if they worked that hard")</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>The trap:</strong> Your coping mechanism (overwork) reinforces the very belief you're trying to disprove.</p>
<h3><strong>The Moving Goalpost</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Get the job → "But I'm junior"</li>
<li>Get promoted → "But I'm not at director level"</li>
<li>Become director → "But I'm not the CEO"</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The pattern:</strong> Achievement doesn't cure imposter syndrome; it just shifts the benchmark.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Strategies That Actually Work</h2>
<h3><strong>1. Reframe Your Self-Talk</strong></h3>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Imposter Thought</th>
<th>Reframe</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>"I got lucky"</td>
<td>"I created conditions for success"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>"Anyone could do this"</td>
<td>"Not everyone did—I did"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>"I don't know enough"</td>
<td>"I know enough to start, and I can learn"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>"They'll find out I'm a fraud"</td>
<td>"I'm learning and growing like everyone else"</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h3><strong>2. Evidence Journaling</strong></h3>
<p><strong>The practice:</strong><br />
- Keep a "wins folder" (emails, compliments, achievements)<br />
- Write down 3 things you did well each week<br />
- Review when imposter feelings arise</p>
<p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Creates objective counter-evidence to challenge negative thoughts.</p>
<h3><strong>3. Separate Feeling from Fact</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Feeling:</strong> "I feel like I don't belong here"<br />
<strong>Fact:</strong> "I was hired based on my qualifications and experience"</p>
<p><strong>The distinction:</strong> Feelings are valid but not always factual.</p>
<h3><strong>4. Talk About It</strong></h3>
<p><strong>The power of sharing:</strong><br />
- Breaks the shame cycle<br />
- Normalises the experience<br />
- Often reveals others feel the same</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Share with a trusted colleague or mentor: "I'm feeling a bit out of my depth—do you ever experience that?"</p>
<h3><strong>5. Redefine Competence</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Old definition:</strong> Knowing everything, never struggling, always getting it right</p>
<p><strong>New definition:</strong><br />
- Willingness to learn<br />
- Ability to problem-solve<br />
- Resilience through challenges<br />
- Asking good questions</p>
<p><strong>The shift:</strong> From fixed ability to growth mindset.</p>
<h3><strong>6. Track Your Growth, Not Just Gaps</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Exercise:</strong></p>
<p>Compare yourself to YOU from a year ago:<br />
- What can you do now that you couldn't then?<br />
- What challenges have you overcome?<br />
- What have you learned?</p>
<p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Shifts focus from "gap to perfection" to "trajectory of growth."</p>
<hr />
<h2>When Imposter Syndrome Serves You</h2>
<p><strong>Plot twist:</strong> Imposter feelings aren't always bad.</p>
<p><strong>Healthy imposter syndrome:</strong><br />
- Signals you're in a growth zone (slight discomfort = learning)<br />
- Motivates preparation and effort<br />
- Keeps you humble and curious<br />
- Prevents overconfidence</p>
<p><strong>Unhealthy imposter syndrome:</strong><br />
- Paralyses you<br />
- Leads to chronic stress<br />
- Prevents you from pursuing opportunities<br />
- Damages wellbeing</p>
<p><strong>The goal:</strong> Not to eliminate imposter feelings, but to prevent them from limiting you.</p>
<hr />
<h2>For Managers: How to Reduce Imposter Syndrome in Your Team</h2>
<h3><strong>1. Normalise Learning and Mistakes</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Share your own learning experiences</li>
<li>Celebrate "intelligent failures"</li>
<li>Frame challenges as growth opportunities</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>2. Give Specific, Behaviour-Based Feedback</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>❌ "You're brilliant!"</li>
<li>✅ "The way you structured that presentation made the data accessible—great work"</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why:</strong> Specific feedback is harder to dismiss as flattery.</p>
<h3><strong>3. Create Psychological Safety</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Make it safe to ask questions</li>
<li>Model vulnerability</li>
<li>Reward curiosity, not just results</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>4. Highlight Process, Not Just Outcomes</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Acknowledge effort and strategy</li>
<li>Discuss what they learned, not just what they achieved</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>The Cultural Dimension</h2>
<p>Imposter syndrome doesn't affect everyone equally:</p>
<p><strong>Groups particularly affected:</strong><br />
- Women in male-dominated fields<br />
- People of colour in predominantly white spaces<br />
- First-generation professionals<br />
- Career changers<br />
- People from working-class backgrounds in professional roles</p>
<p><strong>Why:</strong> When you're underrepresented, every mistake feels like it confirms stereotypes. The stakes feel higher because you're not just representing yourself.</p>
<p><strong>What helps:</strong><br />
- Representation (seeing people like you succeed)<br />
- Mentorship from those with shared experiences<br />
- Community and belonging<br />
- Systemic changes, not just individual fixes</p>
<hr />
<h2>Your Action Plan</h2>
<h3><strong>This Week:</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Identify your type</strong> (Perfectionist, Superhuman, Natural Genius, Soloist, or Expert)</li>
<li><strong>Start a wins folder</strong> (email folder or note)</li>
<li><strong>Share with one person</strong> ("I've been feeling a bit like an imposter—can you relate?")</li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>This Month:</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Track 3 wins per week</strong> in your evidence journal</li>
<li><strong>Challenge one imposter thought</strong> using the reframe table</li>
<li><strong>Notice your growth</strong> (What can you do now that you couldn't 6 months ago?)</li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>Long-term:</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Shift your competence definition</strong> from fixed to growth-based</li>
<li><strong>Build community</strong> with others navigating similar challenges</li>
<li><strong>Remember:</strong> Everyone feels like a fraud sometimes. You're not alone.</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2>Final Thought</h2>
<p>Imposter syndrome isn't a sign you don't belong—it's often a sign you're exactly where you should be: <strong>on the edge of your comfort zone, growing.</strong></p>
<p>The goal isn't to eliminate self-doubt entirely. It's to prevent it from stopping you.</p>
<p>You've got this. (Yes, really.)</p>
