    <h1>From Idea to Impact: A Founder's First 90 Days</h1>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> Entrepreneurship<br />
<strong>Reading Time:</strong> 9 minutes<br />
<strong>Excerpt:</strong> The first 90 days of your startup journey determine whether your idea gains traction or fizzles out. Here's a structured approach to validate, build, and launch with intention.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>You've had the idea. Maybe it came to you in the shower, during a frustrating customer experience, or through spotting a gap in the market. You're excited. You can see the vision.</p>
<p>But where do you actually start?</p>
<p>After supporting hundreds of early-stage founders through entrepreneurship programmes at HKUST and the University of Oxford, I've noticed a pattern: <strong>founders who succeed in the first 90 days aren't the ones with the best ideas—they're the ones with the best process</strong>.</p>
<p>This article breaks down a proven 90-day framework for taking an idea from concept to early traction.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Why the First 90 Days Matter</h2>
<p>The first three months are critical because:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Momentum is fragile</strong> – enthusiasm fades without tangible progress</li>
<li><strong>Assumptions need testing</strong> – what sounds brilliant might not solve a real problem</li>
<li><strong>Resources are limited</strong> – time, money, and energy must be deployed strategically</li>
<li><strong>Habits form</strong> – how you work now shapes how you'll scale later</li>
</ol>
<p>Let's break it into three focused 30-day sprints.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Month 1: Validate the Problem (Days 1-30)</h2>
<h3><strong>The Goal:</strong> Confirm that the problem you're solving is real, urgent, and worth paying for.</h3>
<p>Most startups fail not because they build badly, but because they build something nobody needs. Month 1 is about evidence, not assumptions.</p>
<h3>Week 1: Define Your Hypothesis</h3>
<p>Write down:<br />
- <strong>Who</strong> is your target customer? (Be specific: not "small businesses" but "independent coffee shops in London with 2-10 employees")<br />
- <strong>What problem</strong> are they experiencing?<br />
- <strong>How</strong> are they currently solving it?<br />
- <strong>Why</strong> is the current solution inadequate?</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
"Freelance graphic designers (who) struggle to find consistent clients (what). They currently use generic job boards and social media (how), which are time-consuming and yield low-quality leads (why)."</p>
<h3>Week 2-3: Conduct Problem Interviews</h3>
<p>Speak to 15-20 potential customers. This isn't about pitching your solution—it's about understanding their world.</p>
<p><strong>Ask:</strong><br />
- Tell me about the last time you experienced [problem]<br />
- How are you currently handling this?<br />
- What have you tried that didn't work?<br />
- If you could wave a magic wand, what would the ideal solution look like?<br />
- How much time/money does this problem cost you?</p>
<p><strong>Red flags to watch for:</strong><br />
- "That's interesting, but not really a priority"<br />
- Vague answers without specific examples<br />
- "I'd probably use it" (not "I need this desperately")</p>
<h3>Week 4: Synthesise and Decide</h3>
<p>Review your interviews:<br />
- Did people describe the problem as urgent and costly?<br />
- Are they actively looking for solutions?<br />
- Is there a pattern in what's not working with current options?</p>
<p><strong>Decision point:</strong><br />
- ✅ <strong>Proceed</strong> if you've found genuine, urgent pain<br />
- 🔄 <strong>Pivot</strong> if the problem isn't as pressing as you thought<br />
- ❌ <strong>Stop</strong> if you can't find evidence of real demand</p>
<hr />
<h2>Month 2: Build the Minimum Viable Product (Days 31-60)</h2>
<h3><strong>The Goal:</strong> Create the simplest version of your solution that delivers core value.</h3>
<p>Your MVP isn't about perfection. It's about learning.</p>
<h3>Week 1: Define Core Value</h3>
<p>What's the one thing your product must do to solve the problem?</p>
<p>Strip away every feature except the essential.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
- Not: "A platform with AI matching, calendar integration, payment processing, and portfolio hosting"<br />
- But: "A curated weekly email matching freelancers with vetted client opportunities"</p>
<h3>Week 2-3: Build or Prototype</h3>
<p>Depending on your idea:</p>
<p><strong>No-code MVP options:</strong><br />
- <strong>Landing page + waitlist</strong> (Webflow, Carrd)<br />
- <strong>Concierge MVP</strong> (manually deliver the service)<br />
- <strong>Wizard of Oz</strong> (automate nothing, do it all manually behind the scenes)</p>
<p><strong>Low-code options:</strong><br />
- Bubble, Webflow, Airtable + Zapier<br />
- Notion databases<br />
- Spreadsheets + Google Forms</p>
<p>The goal: something functional enough to test, not something perfect enough to scale.</p>
<h3>Week 4: Prepare for Launch</h3>
<ul>
<li>Create a simple website explaining what you do and why</li>
<li>Define your beta testing criteria (who can join)</li>
<li>Set up basic analytics (Google Analytics, Mixpanel)</li>
<li>Prepare onboarding materials</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Month 3: Get Your First 10 Customers (Days 61-90)</h2>
<h3><strong>The Goal:</strong> Validate that people will actually use (and ideally pay for) your solution.</h3>
<h3>Week 1: Launch to Your Network</h3>
<p>Start with:<br />
- Friends, family, and colleagues who fit your customer profile<br />
- Relevant online communities (LinkedIn groups, Slack channels, Reddit)<br />
- Direct outreach to people you interviewed</p>
<p><strong>Messaging:</strong> Be honest that it's early-stage and you want feedback.</p>
<p>"I built [product] to solve [problem]. It's rough around the edges, but I'm looking for 10 people to test it and help me make it better. Interested?"</p>
<h3>Week 2-3: Engage and Iterate</h3>
<p>Don't just observe—actively engage with early users:<br />
- Schedule weekly check-ins<br />
- Ask what's confusing, frustrating, or missing<br />
- Track which features they actually use vs. ignore<br />
- Measure the core metric that matters (time saved, revenue generated, etc.)</p>
<p><strong>Key question:</strong> Are they coming back? If not, why not?</p>
<h3>Week 4: Reflect and Plan</h3>
<p>By Day 90, you should know:</p>
<p>✅ <strong>Do people have the problem?</strong> (Month 1)<br />
✅ <strong>Does your solution solve it?</strong> (Month 2)<br />
✅ <strong>Will they use it repeatedly?</strong> (Month 3)</p>
<p>If yes to all three → you have early traction. Time to think about growth.</p>
<p>If no → you have invaluable data about what to change.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
<h3>1. Building in Isolation</h3>
<p>Don't spend months perfecting a product without customer input. Ship early, learn fast.</p>
<h3>2. Confusing Interest with Commitment</h3>
<p>"That sounds cool" ≠ "I will pay for this." Look for behaviour, not opinions.</p>
<h3>3. Trying to Serve Everyone</h3>
<p>A narrow, well-defined customer base is easier to reach and serve than "anyone who might need this."</p>
<h3>4. Ignoring the Business Model</h3>
<p>Even if you're pre-revenue, understand how you'll eventually make money. Traction without a path to profitability is a hobby.</p>
<h3>5. Perfectionism Over Progress</h3>
<p>Your MVP will be embarrassing. Launch it anyway. Done is better than perfect.</p>

<h2>What Happens After Day 90?</h2>
<p>If you've validated the problem, built an MVP, and found early traction:</p>
<p><strong>Next steps:</strong><br />
1. <strong>Iterate based on feedback</strong> – improve core features before adding new ones<br />
2. <strong>Define your growth channels</strong> – how will you reach more customers?<br />
3. <strong>Build systems</strong> – processes for onboarding, support, and delivery<br />
4. <strong>Consider fundraising or revenue growth</strong> – depending on your model</p>
<p>If validation didn't happen:<br />
1. <strong>Analyse why</strong> – was it the problem, solution, or market?<br />
2. <strong>Decide:</strong> Pivot or stop?<br />
3. <strong>Extract the learnings</strong> – failed experiments teach as much as successful ones</p>
<hr />
<h2>Real Founder Example</h2>
<p><strong>Case: Emily's Pivot</strong></p>
<p>Emily wanted to build a platform for university students to find part-time freelance work.</p>
<p><strong>Month 1:</strong> Interviewed 20 students. Found they weren't struggling to find work—they were struggling to get paid on time by clients.</p>
<p><strong>Pivot:</strong> Built an invoicing + payment reminder tool instead.</p>
<p><strong>Month 2:</strong> Created a simple Google Sheets template with automated email reminders.</p>
<p><strong>Month 3:</strong> Got 15 students using it. 60% came back after the first use.</p>
<p>By Day 90, Emily had validated a different problem than she started with—but had real traction on something that mattered.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>The first 90 days aren't about building a billion-pound company. They're about <strong>proving you're solving a real problem for real people</strong>.</p>
<p>Move fast. Test assumptions. Listen more than you talk. Ship before you're ready.</p>
<p>Entrepreneurship isn't about having the perfect idea—it's about relentlessly validating, iterating, and improving.</p>
<p>You don't need to have it all figured out. You just need to start.</p>
<hr />
