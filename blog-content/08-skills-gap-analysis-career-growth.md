## What is a Skills Gap Analysis?

**Simple definition:** The difference between the skills you have and the skills you need for your career goals.

**Why it matters:**
- Provides clear direction for professional development
- Prevents wasted time on irrelevant learning
- Makes you strategic (not reactive) about growth
- Increases confidence and career mobility

**The problem:** Most people skip this step and learn randomly, then wonder why they're not progressing.

## The 4-Step Skills Gap Analysis Process

### **Step 1: Define Your Target**

**You can't identify a gap without knowing where you're headed.**

**Questions to answer:**
- What role do I want in 2-3 years?
- What level/seniority am I aiming for?
- What type of organisation do I want to work in?

**Example targets:**
- "Senior Product Manager at a tech scaleup"
- "Head of Marketing in a purpose-driven organisation"
- "Self-employed consultant serving SMEs"

**Be specific.** "I want to progress" is too vague to build a skills plan around.

### **Step 2: Identify Required Skills**

**Three methods to research required skills:**

#### **Method 1: Job Description Analysis**

Find 5-10 job postings for your target role and look for:
- Required skills (mentioned in every posting)
- Nice-to-have skills (mentioned in some postings)
- Recurring keywords and phrases

**Create a spreadsheet:**

| Skill | Frequency | Priority |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| Stakeholder management | 9/10 | High |
| Data analysis | 7/10 | High |
| Agile methodologies | 5/10 | Medium |

#### **Method 2: Informational Interviews**

**Ask people already in your target role:**
- "What skills do you use daily?"
- "What skills were essential to getting this role?"
- "What do you wish you'd developed earlier?"
- "What's becoming more important in this field?"

**Reach out to 3-5 people.** You'll spot patterns.

#### **Method 3: Industry Research**

- Read industry reports on skills trends
- Follow thought leaders in your field
- Check professional body requirements
- Look at LinkedIn's "Skills" section for similar roles

**Combine all three methods** for comprehensive insights.

### **Step 3: Assess Your Current Skills**

**Be honest (and specific).**

**Rating system:**

- **1 - Awareness:** "I know this exists but haven't used it"
- **2 - Basic:** "I can do this with guidance"
- **3 - Competent:** "I can do this independently"
- **4 - Proficient:** "I can do this well and teach others"
- **5 - Expert:** "I'm recognised for this skill"

**Example assessment:**

| Skill | Required Level | Current Level | Gap |
|-------|----------------|---------------|-----|
| Stakeholder management | 4 | 2 | -2 |
| Data analysis | 3 | 3 | 0 |
| Strategic thinking | 4 | 2 | -2 |
| Budget management | 3 | 1 | -2 |

**Tips for honest self-assessment:**
- Ask for feedback from colleagues/manager
- Review recent projects (what did you struggle with?)
- Consider where you avoid tasks (often reveals skill gaps)

### **Step 4: Create Your Development Plan**

**Prioritise based on:**

1. **Urgency:** Which gaps are blocking you NOW?
2. **Impact:** Which skills will have the biggest career ROI?
3. **Feasibility:** Which can you develop relatively quickly?

**The 3-Category System:**

#### **Category A: Critical Gaps (Address in 0-6 months)**
- Essential for your next role
- Currently holding you back
- High impact on career progression

**Example:** If you want to be a manager but have never managed people, leadership skills are Category A.

#### **Category B: Important Gaps (Address in 6-12 months)**
- Important but not immediately blocking
- Will become critical soon
- Worth investing time in now

**Example:** Advanced Excel for a marketing role—useful but not urgent.

#### **Category C: Nice-to-Have (Address in 12+ months)**
- Valuable but not essential
- Can develop opportunistically
- Focus here once A & B are covered

## How to Close the Gaps: Learning Strategies

### **1. On-the-Job Learning (Most Effective)**

**Seek out opportunities:**
- Volunteer for projects that use the skill
- Shadow someone who has the skill
- Ask for stretch assignments
- Request to present/lead in area you're developing

**Example:** Want to improve presentation skills? Offer to present at the next team meeting.

**Why it works:** Real application beats passive learning every time.

### **2. Structured Learning**

**When to use:**
- Need foundational knowledge
- Technical skills with specific certifications
- Want systematic progression

**Options:**
- Online courses (Coursera, LinkedIn Learning)
- Professional certifications
- Workshops and bootcamps
- Formal qualifications (if required)

**Pro tip:** Learn theory, then immediately apply it. Don't just collect certificates.

### **3. Social Learning**

**Leverage people around you:**
- **Mentorship:** Learn from someone experienced
- **Peer learning:** Study groups, accountability partners
- **Reverse mentoring:** Learn from junior colleagues (especially tech skills)
- **Communities:** Join professional groups, online forums

**Example:** Join a local Toastmasters club to develop public speaking.

### **4. Self-Directed Learning**

**For self-starters:**
- Books and articles
- Podcasts and webinars
- YouTube tutorials
- Case studies and research papers

**Make it active:** Take notes, create summaries, apply insights to your work.

## Tracking Progress: The 90-Day Review

**Every quarter, ask:**

1. **What skills have I developed?**
2. **How have I applied them?**
3. **What evidence do I have of improvement?**
4. **What gaps remain?**
5. **What do I need to prioritise next?**

**Create evidence:**
- Keep a wins folder (projects, emails, feedback)
- Document achievements
- Request feedback from manager/peers
- Update your CV/LinkedIn as you grow

---

## Advanced: The T-Shaped Skills Model

**The concept:**
- **Vertical bar (depth):** Deep expertise in one area
- **Horizontal bar (breadth):** Working knowledge across multiple areas

**Why it matters:**
- Specialists struggle to collaborate
- Generalists lack distinctive value
- T-shaped professionals can do both

**Example for a Product Manager:**
- **Depth:** User research and design thinking (expert level)
- **Breadth:** Basic understanding of tech, marketing, data, business strategy

**Action:** Identify your depth area and 3-4 breadth areas to develop.

## Mistakes to Avoid

### **❌ Mistake 1: Learning Without Application**
Don't just collect certificates. Use the skills or you'll forget them.

### **❌ Mistake 2: Focusing Only on Hard Skills**
Soft skills often determine who gets promoted. Don't neglect them.

### **❌ Mistake 3: Never Reassessing**
Your goals change, industries evolve, required skills shift. Review annually.

### **❌ Mistake 4: Trying to Close Every Gap**
You can't be excellent at everything. Prioritise strategically.
