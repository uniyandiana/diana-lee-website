## The Pricing Problem

**Common freelancer experience:**
- You quote a price
- Client accepts immediately
- You instantly regret quoting so low

**Sound familiar?**

You're not alone. Underpricing is one of the most common mistakes freelancers make—and it's driven by psychology, not economics.

---

## Why Freelancers Underprice

### **1. Imposter Syndrome**
"Who am I to charge that much?"

### **2. Scarcity Mindset**
"I should take whatever I can get"

### **3. Comparison Trap**
"Others charge less, so I should too"

### **4. Value Blindness**
"It's easy for me, so it can't be worth much"

**The result:** You work too hard for too little, burn out, and resent your clients.

---

## The Three Pricing Models

### **Model 1: Hourly Rate**

**How it works:** Charge £X per hour

**Pros:**
- Easy to calculate
- Clear for clients
- Protects you from scope creep (in theory)

**Cons:**
- Penalises efficiency (the faster you work, the less you earn)
- Caps your income (only so many hours in a day)
- Focuses on time, not value

**When to use:**
- Very early in freelancing (to establish baseline)
- Projects with truly unpredictable scope
- Retainer-based ongoing work

**Typical UK rates by experience:**
- Beginner: £25-50/hour
- Intermediate: £50-100/hour
- Expert: £100-250/hour
- Specialist: £250+/hour

---

### **Model 2: Project-Based Pricing**

**How it works:** Fixed price for defined deliverables

**Pros:**
- Rewards efficiency
- Predictable income
- Clients prefer budget certainty

**Cons:**
- Risk of underestimating scope
- Need clear boundaries
- Harder to calculate initially

**When to use:**
- Well-defined projects
- You have experience estimating effort
- You want to scale beyond time

**How to calculate:**
1. Estimate hours needed
2. Multiply by your hourly rate
3. Add 20% buffer for revisions/unexpected work
4. Consider value delivered (not just time spent)

---

### **Model 3: Value-Based Pricing**

**How it works:** Price based on value delivered to client, not time spent

**Example:**
- Project takes you 10 hours
- Saves client £50,000/year
- You charge £10,000 (not £500 at £50/hour)

**Pros:**
- Aligns your success with client's success
- Rewards expertise and efficiency
- Potential for significantly higher income

**Cons:**
- Requires deep understanding of client's business
- Harder to quantify value
- Needs confident communication

**When to use:**
- You deeply understand the client's problem
- The value is measurable (revenue, savings, time)
- You're an expert in your field

**Questions to ask clients:**
- "What would success look like?"
- "What's the cost of NOT solving this problem?"
- "What's the potential ROI if this works well?"

## How to Set Your Prices

### **Step 1: Calculate Your Minimum Viable Rate (MVR)**

**What you NEED to earn to survive:**

1. **Annual personal expenses:** £_______
2. **Business expenses** (software, equipment): £_______
3. **Taxes** (roughly 30% if self-employed): £_______
4. **Emergency fund contribution** (10%): £_______

**Total annual needs:** £_______

**Billable hours per year:**
- 52 weeks × 40 hours = 2,080 hours
- Minus holidays (3 weeks): -120 hours
- Minus sick/admin/marketing (30%): -588 hours
- **Realistic billable hours: ~1,370**

**Minimum Hourly Rate = Total Annual Needs ÷ 1,370**

**This is your basement.** Don't go below this.

---

### **Step 2: Research Market Rates**

**Where to look:**
- Freelancer platforms (Upwork, PeoplePerHour)
- Industry salary surveys (calculate freelance equivalent)
- Competitor websites (if they publish rates)
- Professional associations
- Ask peers (be direct: "What do you charge?")

**Calculate the range:**
- Low end (beginners in your field)
- Mid-range (established freelancers)
- High end (experts/specialists)

**Where do YOU sit?**

---

### **Step 3: Factor in Your Unique Value**

**Price premium factors:**

✅ **Specialisation** (+20-50%)
- Niche expertise commands higher rates
- "Copywriter" vs "SaaS email conversion specialist"

✅ **Speed** (+10-30%)
- Fast turnaround has value
- "I can start Monday" vs "I'm free in 6 weeks"

✅ **Results/Track Record** (+30-100%)
- Proven outcomes justify higher prices
- Case studies, testimonials, portfolio

✅ **Reduced Client Risk** (+20-40%)
- Guarantees, insurance, contracts
- Makes you the "safe choice"

✅ **Convenience** (+10-20%)
- Handle everything end-to-end
- Minimal client involvement needed

**Example calculation:**
- Market mid-range: £75/hour
- Specialisation bonus: +£20
- Proven results: +£15
- **Your rate: £110/hour**

## Pricing Psychology: What Actually Works

### **1. Anchor High, Discount Strategically**

**Don't:**
"My rate is £50/hour, but I could do £40 if budget is tight"

**Do:**
"My standard rate is £100/hour. For long-term partnerships, I offer £85/hour"

**Why it works:** You've anchored them to £100, making £85 feel like a deal.

---

### **2. Offer Tiered Packages**

**The "Good, Better, Best" model:**

| Package | Deliverables | Price |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| **Essentials** | Core service only | £500 |
| **Professional** | Core + extras | £850 |
| **Premium** | Everything + support | £1,200 |

**Why it works:**
- Most people choose the middle option
- Makes higher prices feel accessible
- Anchors them away from cheapest option

---

### **3. Price Ending Strategy**

**Psychological pricing:**
- £997 feels significantly less than £1,000
- £1,200 feels more premium than £1,195

**When to use which:**
- **Low-ticket items:** Use .99 or .97
- **Premium services:** Round numbers (conveys quality)

---

### **4. Talk Value, Not Price**

**Don't say:**
"This will take me 20 hours at £50/hour, so £1,000"

**Say instead:**
"This website redesign will increase your conversion rate by an estimated 30%, which based on your current traffic means an additional £15,000 in annual revenue. The investment is £2,500"

**The shift:** From cost to return on investment.

---

## Handling Price Objections

### **"That's too expensive"**

**Response 1:** *Contextualise value*
"I understand. Let's look at ROI—this saves you 10 hours/week, which is £X in your time. The project pays for itself in Y months."

**Response 2:** *Offer a smaller scope*
"What if we started with just Phase 1? That's £X and gets you [specific outcome]."

**Response 3:** *Qualify them*
"It sounds like we might not be the right fit. Let me recommend someone who works at a different price point."

**Don't:** Immediately offer a discount. It devalues your work.

---

### **"Can you do it for £X?"**

**Option 1:** Adjust scope
"At £X, I could deliver A and B, but not C. Would that work?"

**Option 2:** Stand firm
"I'd love to work together, but I can't go below £Y while maintaining quality. Happy to discuss scope adjustments."

**Option 3:** Future discount
"My rate for this project is £Y. If we work together long-term, I offer £X for repeat clients."

---

### **"I need to think about it"**

**Response:**
"Of course! What specific concerns can I address to help your decision?"

**Often reveals:** The real objection (which might not be price).

---

## When to Raise Your Prices

**Signs it's time to increase rates:**

✅ You're fully booked (demand exceeds supply)
✅ Clients accept your quotes without hesitation
✅ You've gained new skills/certifications
✅ You have proven results to show
✅ You're working with bigger/better clients

**How much to raise:**
- Existing clients: 10-15% annually
- New clients: 20-30% if you're consistently booked

**How to communicate:**
"As of [date], my rates for new projects will be £X. Your current project remains at our agreed rate, and I'm offering existing clients a preferential rate of £Y for future work."

---

## Pricing for Different Client Types

### **Startups/Small Businesses**
- Often budget-conscious
- May offer equity/exposure (evaluate carefully)
- Build relationships for long-term work

**Strategy:** Project-based, with clear scope

### **Corporates/Enterprises**
- Larger budgets
- Slower decision-making
- Value reliability and process

**Strategy:** Higher rates, value-based pricing, retainers

### **Nonprofits/Social Enterprises**
- Limited budgets but meaningful work
- Networking opportunities
- Personal fulfilment

**Strategy:** Discounted "purpose rate" if aligned with values

---

## Your Pricing Action Plan

### **This Week:**
1. Calculate your Minimum Viable Rate
2. Research 5 competitors' pricing
3. List your unique value factors

### **This Month:**
1. Set your pricing (hourly OR project-based)
2. Create 3-tier package options
3. Practice your pricing conversation with a friend

### **Before Your Next Project:**
1. Prepare value-focused quotes
2. Anticipate objections and prepare responses
3. Commit to NOT discounting immediately

---

## Final Thought

**Pricing isn't just about numbers. It's about valuing yourself.**

When you underprice, you:
- Attract clients who don't value you
- Work resentfully
- Can't deliver your best work
- Burn out faster

**Charge what you're worth.** Your future self will thank you.
