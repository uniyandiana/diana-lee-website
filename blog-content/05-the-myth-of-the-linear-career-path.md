# The Myth of the Linear Career Path: Why "Up" Isn't the Only Way Forward

**Excerpt:** We're taught that career success means climbing a ladder. But what if the most fulfilling careers don't follow straight lines? It's time to rethink what progress really looks like.

## Introduction

"Where do you see yourself in five years?"

It's the classic interview question—and it's built on a flawed assumption: that careers move in predictable, upward trajectories.

In reality, the most interesting, fulfilling careers I've witnessed rarely follow linear paths. They zig-zag. They pivot. They pause. They explore.

Yet we're still conditioned to believe that success looks like:
1. Entry-level → 2. Mid-level → 3. Senior → 4. Executive

Anything else feels like failure.

It's time to challenge this narrative.

## The Linear Career Myth: Where It Came From

The "career ladder" made sense in the industrial era:
- Jobs were stable
- Industries were predictable
- Loyalty was rewarded
- One company, one climb

But that world no longer exists.

Today:
- The average person changes careers 5-7 times
- Entire industries emerge and disappear within decades
- Skills have shorter shelf lives
- Companies restructure constantly

Yet we're still using a 20th-century career model in a 21st-century reality.

## What Modern Careers Actually Look Like

Instead of ladders, think of careers as:

### 1. **Career Lattices**
Moving sideways, diagonally, and upwards across different functions, industries, and roles.

**Example:** Marketing → Product Management → Startup Founder → Corporate Strategy → Consulting

### 2. **Portfolio Careers**
Multiple roles simultaneously, each fulfilling different needs.

**Example:** Part-time lecturer + freelance consultant + board advisor

### 3. **Seasonal Careers**
Periods of intense work followed by rest, learning, or exploration.

**Example:** 3 years in high-growth startup → 6 months travelling/upskilling → Strategic role in established company

### 4. **Squiggly Careers**
Non-linear, exploratory paths that follow curiosity and opportunity.

**Example:** Teacher → EdTech Product Manager → Learning Experience Designer → Educational Consultant

## Why "Up" Isn't Always the Answer

### Promotion Isn't Always Progress

Not everyone wants to manage people.
Not everyone thrives in senior leadership.
Not everyone defines success as title and salary.

**Questions to ask before pursuing promotion:**
- Do I want the actual responsibilities, or just the status?
- Will this role use my strengths or require me to develop new ones I'm less interested in?
- Am I chasing someone else's definition of success?

### Lateral Moves Build Broader Skills

Staying in one function limits your perspective. Moving laterally:
- Builds diverse skill sets
- Expands your network
- Increases adaptability
- Opens unexpected opportunities

**Example:** A finance professional who moves into operations gains cross-functional insight that makes them a stronger future CFO than someone who stayed in finance their whole career.

### Strategic "Pauses" Aren't Wasted Time

Career breaks, sabbaticals, and transitions create space for:
- Skill development
- Reflection and recalibration
- Caring for family or health
- Exploring new interests

The myth says: gaps in your CV are red flags.
The reality: intentional pauses often lead to better long-term decisions.

## Redefining Career Success

Instead of asking *"Am I moving up?"* ask:

### 1. **Am I Learning?**
Growth matters more than titles. Are you developing skills that will serve you long-term?

### 2. **Am I Energised?**
Does your work give you energy or drain it? Sustainability matters.

### 3. **Am I Aligned?**
Does this role reflect your values, strengths, and interests? Or are you chasing external validation?

### 4. **Am I Building Optionality?**
Are you creating opportunities for future moves, or boxing yourself in?

## How to Navigate a Non-Linear Career

### 1. Embrace Exploration

Give yourself permission to try things.

- **Volunteer** in areas you're curious about
- **Take on stretch projects** outside your core role
- **Experiment through side projects** before committing fully

Exploration isn't distraction—it's strategic research.

### 2. Build Transferable Skills

Invest in skills that travel across industries:
- Communication and storytelling
- Problem-solving and critical thinking
- Relationship-building and influence
- Adaptability and learning agility

These matter more than technical expertise tied to one field.

### 3. Rewrite Your Narrative

When explaining your non-linear path:

**Don't say:** "I've jumped around a lot."
**Do say:** "I've intentionally built diverse experience in [X, Y, Z], which gives me a unique perspective on [outcome]."

**Example:**
*"I've worked across education, technology, and consulting, which allows me to design learning experiences that are both pedagogically sound and technically feasible."*

### 4. Curate Your Professional Identity

Your CV doesn't have to be chronological. Consider:
- **Functional CV:** Organised by skill areas, not timeline
- **Narrative CV:** Tells a story of intentional growth
- **Portfolio approach:** Show outcomes, not just roles

### 5. Find Your "Red Thread"

Even in non-linear careers, there's often a consistent theme.

Ask: *"What's the through-line in my work?"*

**Examples:**
- Helping organisations scale
- Making complex things accessible
- Building communities
- Solving problems creatively

Your red thread is what connects seemingly disparate experiences into a coherent story.

## When to Go Linear vs. Non-Linear

### Linear Makes Sense When:
- You're in a field with clear progression (medicine, law, academia)
- You're deeply passionate about a specific craft and want mastery
- You thrive with structure and predictable growth
- You're in an industry that rewards tenure

### Non-Linear Makes Sense When:
- You have multiple interests and don't want to pick just one
- You value learning over titles
- You're in fast-changing industries (tech, media, social impact)
- You want flexibility and autonomy

**Neither is better. But most people assume linear is the default—and it's not.**

## Real-World Examples of Non-Linear Success

### Example 1: Sara
- Started as a lawyer
- Moved into corporate compliance
- Pivoted to startup operations
- Now runs a consultancy helping startups navigate legal and operational risk

**Red thread:** Navigating complexity and risk.

### Example 2: Raj
- Trained as an engineer
- Became a teacher
- Moved into EdTech product design
- Freelances whilst raising young children

**Red thread:** Helping people learn technical concepts.

### Example 3: Maria
- Worked in banking
- Took a career break for family
- Retrained as a coach
- Now advises financial professionals on career transitions

**Red thread:** Helping people make informed decisions about their future.

## What This Means for You

If your career doesn't look like a neat ladder—good.

You're not behind. You're not confused. You're not failing.

You're navigating the reality of modern work: that fulfilment comes from alignment, not altitude.

**The question isn't:** "Am I climbing fast enough?"

**The question is:** "Am I building a career that reflects who I am and what I value?"

---

## Final Thoughts

The career ladder is a myth that no longer serves us.

Modern careers are messy, exploratory, and non-linear—and that's not a bug, it's a feature.

You don't need a five-year plan.
You don't need to have it all figured out.
You don't need to move "up" to move forward.

You just need to keep asking: *"What's the next right move for me?"*

And trust that a winding path often leads somewhere more interesting than a straight line ever could.

## Reflection Questions

1. **What does success look like for me** (not my parents, not society, not LinkedIn)?
2. **What's my red thread**—the consistent theme across my varied experiences?
3. **Am I chasing a title, or am I chasing growth, meaning, and alignment?**
4. **Where have I been conditioned to think I should go, vs. where I actually want to go?**
