# From Idea to Impact: A Founder's First 90 Days

**Category:** Entrepreneurship
**Reading Time:** 9 minutes
**Excerpt:** The first 90 days of your startup journey determine whether your idea gains traction or fizzles out. Here's a structured approach to validate, build, and launch with intention.

## Introduction

You've had the idea. Maybe it came to you in the shower, during a frustrating customer experience, or through spotting a gap in the market. You're excited. You can see the vision.

But where do you actually start?

After supporting hundreds of early-stage founders through entrepreneurship programmes at HKUST and the University of Oxford, I've noticed a pattern: **founders who succeed in the first 90 days aren't the ones with the best ideas—they're the ones with the best process**.

This article breaks down a proven 90-day framework for taking an idea from concept to early traction.

## Why the First 90 Days Matter

The first three months are critical because:

1. **Momentum is fragile** – enthusiasm fades without tangible progress
2. **Assumptions need testing** – what sounds brilliant might not solve a real problem
3. **Resources are limited** – time, money, and energy must be deployed strategically
4. **Habits form** – how you work now shapes how you'll scale later

Let's break it into three focused 30-day sprints.

## Month 1: Validate the Problem (Days 1-30)

### **The Goal:** Confirm that the problem you're solving is real, urgent, and worth paying for.

Most startups fail not because they build badly, but because they build something nobody needs. Month 1 is about evidence, not assumptions.

### Week 1: Define Your Hypothesis

Write down:
- **Who** is your target customer? (Be specific: not "small businesses" but "independent coffee shops in London with 2-10 employees")
- **What problem** are they experiencing?
- **How** are they currently solving it?
- **Why** is the current solution inadequate?

**Example:**
"Freelance graphic designers (who) struggle to find consistent clients (what). They currently use generic job boards and social media (how), which are time-consuming and yield low-quality leads (why)."

### Week 2-3: Conduct Problem Interviews

Speak to 15-20 potential customers. This isn't about pitching your solution—it's about understanding their world.

**Ask:**
- Tell me about the last time you experienced [problem]
- How are you currently handling this?
- What have you tried that didn't work?
- If you could wave a magic wand, what would the ideal solution look like?
- How much time/money does this problem cost you?

**Red flags to watch for:**
- "That's interesting, but not really a priority"
- Vague answers without specific examples
- "I'd probably use it" (not "I need this desperately")

### Week 4: Synthesise and Decide

Review your interviews:
- Did people describe the problem as urgent and costly?
- Are they actively looking for solutions?
- Is there a pattern in what's not working with current options?

**Decision point:**
- ✅ **Proceed** if you've found genuine, urgent pain
- 🔄 **Pivot** if the problem isn't as pressing as you thought
- ❌ **Stop** if you can't find evidence of real demand

## Month 2: Build the Minimum Viable Product (Days 31-60)

### **The Goal:** Create the simplest version of your solution that delivers core value.

Your MVP isn't about perfection. It's about learning.

### Week 1: Define Core Value

What's the one thing your product must do to solve the problem?

Strip away every feature except the essential.

**Example:**
- Not: "A platform with AI matching, calendar integration, payment processing, and portfolio hosting"
- But: "A curated weekly email matching freelancers with vetted client opportunities"

### Week 2-3: Build or Prototype

Depending on your idea:

**No-code MVP options:**
- **Landing page + waitlist** (Webflow, Carrd)
- **Concierge MVP** (manually deliver the service)
- **Wizard of Oz** (automate nothing, do it all manually behind the scenes)

**Low-code options:**
- Bubble, Webflow, Airtable + Zapier
- Notion databases
- Spreadsheets + Google Forms

The goal: something functional enough to test, not something perfect enough to scale.

### Week 4: Prepare for Launch

- Create a simple website explaining what you do and why
- Define your beta testing criteria (who can join)
- Set up basic analytics (Google Analytics, Mixpanel)
- Prepare onboarding materials

---

## Month 3: Get Your First 10 Customers (Days 61-90)

### **The Goal:** Validate that people will actually use (and ideally pay for) your solution.

### Week 1: Launch to Your Network

Start with:
- Friends, family, and colleagues who fit your customer profile
- Relevant online communities (LinkedIn groups, Slack channels, Reddit)
- Direct outreach to people you interviewed

**Messaging:** Be honest that it's early-stage and you want feedback.

"I built [product] to solve [problem]. It's rough around the edges, but I'm looking for 10 people to test it and help me make it better. Interested?"

### Week 2-3: Engage and Iterate

Don't just observe—actively engage with early users:
- Schedule weekly check-ins
- Ask what's confusing, frustrating, or missing
- Track which features they actually use vs. ignore
- Measure the core metric that matters (time saved, revenue generated, etc.)

**Key question:** Are they coming back? If not, why not?

### Week 4: Reflect and Plan

By Day 90, you should know:

✅ **Do people have the problem?** (Month 1)
✅ **Does your solution solve it?** (Month 2)
✅ **Will they use it repeatedly?** (Month 3)

If yes to all three → you have early traction. Time to think about growth.

If no → you have invaluable data about what to change.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Building in Isolation
Don't spend months perfecting a product without customer input. Ship early, learn fast.

### 2. Confusing Interest with Commitment
"That sounds cool" ≠ "I will pay for this." Look for behaviour, not opinions.

### 3. Trying to Serve Everyone
A narrow, well-defined customer base is easier to reach and serve than "anyone who might need this."

### 4. Ignoring the Business Model
Even if you're pre-revenue, understand how you'll eventually make money. Traction without a path to profitability is a hobby.

### 5. Perfectionism Over Progress
Your MVP will be embarrassing. Launch it anyway. Done is better than perfect.

## Metrics to Track

In your first 90 days, focus on:

| Metric | Target | Why It Matters |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| Problem interviews | 15-20 | Validates demand |
| MVP beta users | 10-25 | Proves usability |
| Active users (Week 2) | 50%+ of sign-ups | Indicates real value |
| Customer feedback sessions | 5-10 | Guides iteration |
| Paying customers (if applicable) | 3-5 | Validates willingness to pay |

---

## What Happens After Day 90?

If you've validated the problem, built an MVP, and found early traction:

**Next steps:**
1. **Iterate based on feedback** – improve core features before adding new ones
2. **Define your growth channels** – how will you reach more customers?
3. **Build systems** – processes for onboarding, support, and delivery
4. **Consider fundraising or revenue growth** – depending on your model

If validation didn't happen:
1. **Analyse why** – was it the problem, solution, or market?
2. **Decide:** Pivot or stop?
3. **Extract the learnings** – failed experiments teach as much as successful ones

## Real Founder Example

**Case: Emily's Pivot**

Emily wanted to build a platform for university students to find part-time freelance work.

**Month 1:** Interviewed 20 students. Found they weren't struggling to find work—they were struggling to get paid on time by clients.

**Pivot:** Built an invoicing + payment reminder tool instead.

**Month 2:** Created a simple Google Sheets template with automated email reminders.

**Month 3:** Got 15 students using it. 60% came back after the first use.

By Day 90, Emily had validated a different problem than she started with—but had real traction on something that mattered.

## Final Thoughts

The first 90 days aren't about building a billion-pound company. They're about **proving you're solving a real problem for real people**.

Move fast. Test assumptions. Listen more than you talk. Ship before you're ready.

Entrepreneurship isn't about having the perfect idea—it's about relentlessly validating, iterating, and improving.

You don't need to have it all figured out. You just need to start.
