## What is Emotional Intelligence?

**Emotional Intelligence (EQ):** The ability to recognize, understand, and manage your own emotions AND the emotions of others.

**Daniel Goleman's Five Components:**

1. **Self-awareness:** Knowing your emotions and their impact
2. **Self-regulation:** Managing your emotions effectively
3. **Motivation:** Drive to achieve beyond external rewards
4. **Empathy:** Understanding others' emotions
5. **Social skills:** Managing relationships effectively

**The research:** EQ accounts for 58% of job performance, and 90% of top performers have high EQ.

**The truth:** IQ gets you the job. EQ determines how far you go.

## Why EQ Matters More Than Ever

**The modern workplace reality:**
- Remote teams require stronger empathy
- Diverse teams need cultural intelligence
- Change is constant (requires emotional resilience)
- Collaboration is essential (requires social skills)
- Mental health matters (requires self-awareness)

**What high-EQ leaders do differently:**
- Navigate conflicts constructively
- Build trust quickly
- Motivate diverse teams
- Adapt to change
- Create psychological safety

**Low-EQ leaders:**
- Struggle with conflict
- Have high team turnover
- Create toxic cultures
- Resist feedback
- Wonder why people don't follow them

## Component 1: Self-Awareness

**Definition:** Understanding your emotions, strengths, weaknesses, values, and impact on others.

### **Why It Matters**

**Without self-awareness:**
- You react instead of respond
- You blame others instead of reflecting
- You're surprised when feedback doesn't match your self-perception

**With self-awareness:**
- You catch yourself before reacting poorly
- You understand your triggers
- You seek feedback actively

### **How to Build Self-Awareness**

**Practice 1: Daily Emotional Check-Ins**

**Ask yourself (morning and evening):**
- How am I feeling right now?
- What's driving that emotion?
- How might this affect my behaviour today?

**Emotion wheel** (use specific words):
- Not just "bad" → frustrated, overwhelmed, disappointed?
- Not just "good" → energised, proud, hopeful?

**Practice 2: The 5 Whys**

**When you feel strong emotion, dig deeper:**

1. I'm frustrated
2. Why? → The project is delayed
3. Why does that frustrate me? → I feel like I'm losing control
4. Why does control matter? → I'm afraid of looking incompetent
5. Aha! → The real emotion is fear, not frustration

**Practice 3: Seek External Perspectives**

**Ask 5 people:**
"What's one thing I do well, and one thing I could improve?"

**Listen without defending.** Their perception IS your reality as a leader.

---

## Component 2: Self-Regulation

**Definition:** Managing your emotions so they don't control you.

### **Why It Matters**

**Scenario:**
- A team member misses a deadline
- **Low EQ response:** Snap at them publicly
- **High EQ response:** Feel frustration, pause, address it privately and constructively

**Self-regulation ≠ suppressing emotions.** It's expressing them appropriately.

### **How to Build Self-Regulation**

**Strategy 1: The 6-Second Pause**

**When triggered:**
1. Notice the emotion
2. Take 6 seconds before responding
3. Choose your response

**Why 6 seconds?** Long enough to interrupt a reactive pattern, short enough to stay present.

**Strategy 2: Reframe**

**Practice cognitive reframing:**

| Situation | Reactive thought | Reframe |
|-----------|-----------------|---------|
| Team member challenges your idea | "They're undermining me" | "They're engaged and thinking critically" |
| Project fails | "I'm a terrible leader" | "This is a learning opportunity" |
| Critical feedback | "They don't appreciate me" | "They want me to grow" |

**Strategy 3: Physical Release**

**Emotions live in the body. Release them physically:**
- Walk it off
- Exercise
- Breathe deeply (4-7-8 breathing)
- Journal

**Don't:** Make big decisions when emotionally flooded.

---

## Component 3: Motivation

**Definition:** Internal drive to achieve, grow, and improve—beyond external rewards.

### **Why It Matters**

**Extrinsically motivated leaders:**
- Burn out when rewards stop
- Create transactional cultures
- Struggle when facing obstacles

**Intrinsically motivated leaders:**
- Persist through setbacks
- Inspire others
- Find meaning in challenges

### **How to Build Intrinsic Motivation**

**Practice 1: Connect to Purpose**

**Ask:**
- Why does this work matter beyond money/status?
- Who benefits from what I do?
- What impact do I want to have?

**Revisit your "why" regularly.**

**Practice 2: Set Mastery Goals**

**Not:** "I want the promotion"
**Instead:** "I want to become excellent at strategic thinking"

**Focus on growth, not outcomes.**

**Practice 3: Celebrate Progress**

Track small wins:
- What did I learn this week?
- What challenge did I navigate well?
- How did I grow?

## Component 4: Empathy

**Definition:** Understanding and sharing the feelings of others.

### **Why It Matters**

**Without empathy:**
- You miss what's really going on with your team
- People don't feel heard
- You make decisions that miss human impact

**With empathy:**
- You build deep trust
- You pre-empt issues
- You create loyalty

### **How to Build Empathy**

**Practice 1: Active Listening**

**The formula:**
1. **Listen without interrupting** (truly listen, don't just wait to speak)
2. **Reflect back what you heard:** "It sounds like you're feeling X because Y—is that right?"
3. **Validate:** "That makes sense" or "I can see why that's frustrating"
4. **Ask:** "What would be helpful right now?"

**Common trap:** Jumping to solutions before understanding the emotion.

**Practice 2: Perspective-Taking**

**Before reacting to someone's behaviour, ask:**
- What might be going on for them?
- What pressures might they be under?
- How might they be experiencing this situation?

**Example:**
- Team member is snappy in meetings
- **Judgment:** "They're rude"
- **Empathy:** "They might be overwhelmed/stressed/dealing with something personal"

**Practice 3: Curiosity Over Judgment**

**Replace:** "That's a terrible idea"
**With:** "Help me understand your thinking on this"

---

## Component 5: Social Skills

**Definition:** Managing relationships to move people in desired directions.

### **Why It Matters**

**Leaders with strong social skills:**
- Build diverse, high-performing teams
- Navigate politics effectively
- Influence without authority
- Resolve conflicts constructively

### **How to Build Social Skills**

**Skill 1: Giving Effective Feedback**

**The SBI Model:**
1. **Situation:** "In yesterday's client meeting..."
2. **Behaviour:** "When you interrupted the client mid-sentence..."
3. **Impact:** "It came across as dismissive and they shut down"

**Not:** "You're always rude in meetings"

**Skill 2: Conflict Navigation**

**Steps:**
1. **Acknowledge emotions:** "I can see you're frustrated"
2. **Separate person from problem:** "We're not adversaries, we have a problem to solve"
3. **Focus on interests, not positions:** "What do you need from this situation?"
4. **Collaborate on solutions:** "What if we tried...?"

**Skill 3: Building Rapport**

**Quick wins:**
- Remember details people share (write them down!)
- Ask follow-up questions ("How did your son's concert go?")
- Show vulnerability (share your own challenges)
- Give specific praise ("The way you handled that client was brilliant")

## EQ in Action: Real Leadership Scenarios

### **Scenario 1: Delivering Bad News**

**Low EQ:**
"The project's cancelled. Start working on X instead."

**High EQ:**
"I have difficult news. The project is being cancelled due to budget cuts. I know you've invested a lot, and I'm disappointed too. Let's talk about how you're feeling and what you'd like to work on next."

**Difference:** Acknowledges emotion, shows empathy, invites conversation.

---

### **Scenario 2: Team Member Underperforming**

**Low EQ:**
"Your performance is unacceptable. Improve or we'll have to let you go."

**High EQ:**
"I've noticed you're not hitting your usual standards. That's not like you. Is everything okay? How can I support you?"

**Difference:** Curiosity before judgment, offers support.

---

### **Scenario 3: Receiving Criticism**

**Low EQ:**
"That's not fair. You don't understand what I'm dealing with."

**High EQ:**
"Thank you for sharing that. Give me a moment to process. Can you help me understand specifically what you'd like to see differently?"

**Difference:** Pauses, seeks to understand, doesn't defend immediately.

---

## Measuring Your EQ Progress

### **Self-Assessment Questions**

**Self-Awareness:**
- Can I name my current emotion accurately?
- Do I know what triggers strong reactions in me?

**Self-Regulation:**
- Can I pause before reacting when upset?
- Do I express emotions appropriately?

**Motivation:**
- Am I driven by purpose or just rewards?
- Do I persist through setbacks?

**Empathy:**
- Do people feel heard by me?
- Can I see situations from others' perspectives?

**Social Skills:**
- Do people seek me out for advice?
- Can I influence others without authority?

**Rate yourself 1-5 on each.** Where are your gaps?

**Fix:** Pick ONE component, focus for 3 months

### **Mistake 2: Knowing Without Doing**
**Fix:** EQ isn't theoretical—practice daily

### **Mistake 3: Expecting Instant Results**
**Fix:** EQ is a lifelong practice, not a quick fix
