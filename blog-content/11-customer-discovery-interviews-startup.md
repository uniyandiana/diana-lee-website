## Why Most Customer Interviews Fail

**Common founder mistake:**
"Would you use an app that helps you manage your tasks better?"

**Customer response:**
"Yeah, that sounds great!"

**What happens next:**
You build it. No one uses it.

**What went wrong?** You asked about hypothetical future behaviour, not actual past behaviour. People are terrible at predicting what they'll do.

---

## The Golden Rule of Customer Discovery

**Talk about their life, not your idea.**

Your goal isn't to validate your solution. It's to deeply understand their problem.

### **Bad Interview Mindset:**
"I need to convince them my idea is good"

### **Good Interview Mindset:**
"I need to understand if the problem I think exists actually exists"

**The shift:** From pitching to learning.

## The Mom Test Framework

**Based on Rob Fitzpatrick's book "The Mom Test"**

**The principle:** Ask questions that even your mum couldn't lie to you about.

### **The Three Rules:**

1. **Talk about their life, not your idea**
2. **Ask about specifics in the past, not generics or opinions about the future**
3. **Talk less, listen more**

Let's break these down.

---

## Rule 1: Talk About Their Life (Not Your Idea)

### **❌ DON'T Say:**
"I'm building an app for freelancers to track time. Would you use it?"

**Why it fails:**
- Puts them in "be nice" mode
- Asks them to imagine the future (they're bad at this)
- You get polite lies

### **✅ DO Say:**
"How do you currently track time for client projects?"

**Why it works:**
- Asks about real behaviour
- Reveals actual pain points
- Gets honest answers

**Follow-up questions:**
- "What's frustrating about that process?"
- "How much time does it take you?"
- "Have you tried other solutions?"
- "What didn't work about them?"

---

## Rule 2: Ask About the Past (Not the Future)

**People are terrible at predicting their behaviour.**

### **❌ DON'T Ask:**
- "Would you buy this?"
- "How much would you pay?"
- "Would you switch from your current solution?"

**Why these fail:** Hypothetical questions get hypothetical answers ("Yeah, probably!" doesn't mean they'll actually buy).

### **✅ DO Ask:**
- "Tell me about the last time this problem happened"
- "What did you do when that happened?"
- "Have you looked for solutions to this before?"
- "What have you tried that didn't work?"
- "How much are you currently spending on this problem?"

**The difference:** Past behaviour predicts future behaviour. Stated intentions don't.

---

## Rule 3: Talk Less, Listen More

**Your ideal talk-to-listen ratio: 20/80**

**You talk 20%:** Asking questions
**You listen 80%:** Understanding their world

### **Signs You're Talking Too Much:**
- You're explaining features
- You're defending your idea
- You're steering the conversation
- You're excited about their validation

### **How to Listen Better:**
- Ask open questions
- Embrace awkward silences (they fill them with insights)
- Take notes (or record with permission)
- Follow their tangents (often where gold is hidden)

## The Customer Discovery Interview Script

### **Phase 1: Context Setting (5 minutes)**

**Your intro:**
"Thanks for meeting with me. I'm researching [problem area] and would love to learn about your experience. I'm NOT selling anything today—I genuinely want to understand how you currently handle [problem]. Is that okay?"

**Why this works:**
- Takes pressure off them
- Removes "sales mode"
- Gets honest answers

**Opening question:**
"Can you walk me through your current process for [activity related to problem]?"

---

### **Phase 2: Problem Exploration (15-20 minutes)**

**Uncover the pain:**

**Question set 1: Current state**
- "How do you currently handle [problem]?"
- "How long does that typically take?"
- "Who else is involved in the process?"

**Question set 2: Pain points**
- "What's frustrating about the way you do this now?"
- "Tell me about a recent time when this was particularly painful"
- "If you could wave a magic wand, what would change?"

**Question set 3: Workarounds**
- "Have you tried to solve this before?"
- "What solutions have you looked at?"
- "What did you try that didn't work?"
- "Why didn't that work?"

**Question set 4: Impact**
- "How much does this problem cost you?" (time/money/stress)
- "What happens if you don't solve this?"
- "Is this a top-3 problem for you right now?"

---

### **Phase 3: Solution Discovery (10 minutes)**

**Only if the problem is validated, gently explore solutions:**

**Still don't pitch. Explore:**
- "If there was a solution to this, what would it need to do?"
- "What would make you switch from your current approach?"
- "What concerns would you have about changing?"

**Critical question:**
"If I could solve this problem perfectly, is it something you'd be willing to pay for?"

**If yes:**
"What are you currently spending on this problem?" (reveals real budget)

**If no:**
"Help me understand why not" (reveals it's not painful enough)

---

### **Phase 4: Next Steps (5 minutes)**

**Ask for commitments (not compliments):**

**❌ DON'T Ask:**
"What do you think of this idea?"

**✅ DO Ask:**
- "Can I show you a rough prototype when I have one?"
- "Would you be willing to beta test this?"
- "Can you introduce me to others who have this problem?"

**Real interest = willingness to commit time/attention.**

**Thank them:**
"This has been incredibly helpful. Can I follow up if I have questions?"

---

## The Questions You're Afraid to Ask (But Should)

### **1. "Why haven't you solved this already?"**
**Reveals:** Whether the problem is painful enough to warrant a solution

### **2. "What else have you tried that failed?"**
**Reveals:** The competitive landscape and why existing solutions don't work

### **3. "Is this a top-3 priority for you right now?"**
**Reveals:** Whether they'll actually use/buy your solution (or just think it's "nice to have")

### **4. "Can you introduce me to others with this problem?"**
**Reveals:** Whether they're truly engaged (real interest = willingness to help)

## Red Flags in Customer Discovery

**Watch out for these responses:**

### **🚩 "That sounds really interesting!"**
**Translation:** "I'm being polite"
**What to do:** Dig deeper into their actual behaviour

### **🚩 "I might use that someday"**
**Translation:** "This isn't urgent for me"
**What to do:** Find out what IS urgent

### **🚩 "I think you should add [feature X, Y, Z]"**
**Translation:** They're designing your product for you
**What to do:** Ask why they need that feature. What problem does it solve?

### **🚩 "That's a good idea, you should talk to [other person]"**
**Translation:** This isn't their problem
**What to do:** Thank them and move on

### **🚩 Vague answers without specific examples**
**Translation:** They're hypothesising, not remembering
**What to do:** "Can you tell me about the last specific time this happened?"

## Green Flags (You're Onto Something)

**Positive signals:**

✅ **They get animated when describing the problem**
**Means:** This is a real, painful problem

✅ **They describe specific, recent instances**
**Means:** This happens frequently

✅ **They've tried multiple solutions that failed**
**Means:** They're actively seeking a solution

✅ **They're currently spending money/time on workarounds**
**Means:** They have budget for a better solution

✅ **They ask when they can use what you're building**
**Means:** Real urgency

✅ **They offer to introduce you to others**
**Means:** Genuine engagement

## How Many Interviews Do You Need?

**Minimum:** 15-20 problem interviews before building anything

**Why this many:**
- First 5: You're learning to ask good questions
- Next 10: You're discovering patterns
- After 15: You start hearing the same things (diminishing returns)

**Keep going until:**
- You stop hearing new information
- Clear patterns emerge
- You can predict what interviewees will say

**Then (and only then):** Build a solution.

---

## Common Mistakes (and How to Fix Them)

### **Mistake 1: Pitching Your Idea**
**Fix:** Pretend you haven't built anything yet (even if you have)

### **Mistake 2: Asking Leading Questions**
**Fix:** Make questions neutral ("How do you currently handle X?" not "Isn't it frustrating how you handle X?")

### **Mistake 3: Interviewing Friends/Family**
**Fix:** Find your actual target customer (friends are biased)

### **Mistake 4: Seeking Validation**
**Fix:** Seek truth. You want to know if you're wrong NOW, not after you've built it

### **Mistake 5: Not Taking Notes**
**Fix:** Write everything down or record (with permission)

---

## After the Interviews: Making Sense of Data

### **Look for Patterns:**

**Create a spreadsheet:**

| Interviewee | Problem Frequency | Pain Level (1-10) | Current Solution | Willing to Pay? | Top Priority? |
|-------------|------------------|-------------------|------------------|-----------------|---------------|
| Person 1 | Daily | 8 | Spreadsheets | Yes | Yes |
| Person 2 | Weekly | 5 | Nothing | Maybe | No |

**Analyse:**
- What problems come up repeatedly?
- Who experiences the most pain?
- What solutions have failed?
- Who's willing to pay?

**Decision criteria:**
- **Build:** Problem is urgent, frequent, expensive, top-3 priority
- **Pivot:** Problem exists but isn't urgent enough
- **Stop:** No consistent problem pattern

2. Take detailed notes
3. Look for patterns in responses

### **Before Building:**
1. Validate that the problem is urgent and expensive

## Final Thought

**Most startups fail because they build something nobody wants.**

Customer discovery interviews are your insurance policy against this.

Ask the right questions. Listen deeply. Build what people actually need.
