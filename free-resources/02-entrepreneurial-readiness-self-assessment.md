*Created by Diana Lee | Enterprise Educator*

## About This Assessment

Not everyone is ready to start a business—and that's okay. This assessment helps you honestly evaluate where you are and what you need before taking the leap.

**Time required:** 20-30 minutes

**Output:** A clear picture of your entrepreneurial readiness across 6 key dimensions

---

## How to Use This Assessment

For each statement, rate yourself honestly:

- **1** = Strongly disagree
- **2** = Disagree
- **3** = Neutral
- **4** = Agree
- **5** = Strongly agree

Be brutally honest. This isn't about what you wish were true—it's about where you actually are right now.
