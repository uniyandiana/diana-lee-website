# Startup Idea Validation Checklist
### Test Your Idea Before You Build

*Created by Diana Lee | Enterprise Educator*

## Why Validation Matters

Most startups fail not because they build badly, but because they build something nobody wants. This checklist helps you validate demand before investing significant time and money.

**Use this before building your MVP.**

---

## Phase 1: Problem Validation

### ✓ I can clearly define the problem

**The problem is:**
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

**People experience this when:**
_______________________________________________________________

**It costs them (time/money/frustration):**
_______________________________________________________________

---

### ✓ I know exactly who has this problem

**My target customer is:**
- **Demographics:** (age, location, job title, industry)
  _______________________________________________________________
- **Psychographics:** (goals, challenges, behaviours)
  _______________________________________________________________
- **Where they hang out:** (online communities, events, platforms)
  _______________________________________________________________

---

### ✓ I've spoken to real potential customers

**Customer interview checklist:**
- [ ] I've conducted at least 15-20 problem interviews
- [ ] I asked about their current solutions (not pitched mine)
- [ ] I heard specific, painful examples of the problem
- [ ] They're actively looking for better solutions
- [ ] They'd be willing to pay for a solution

**Red flags I did NOT encounter:**
- [ ] "That's interesting, but not urgent"
- [ ] Vague answers without specifics
- [ ] "I might use it someday"
- [ ] Polite interest but no real pain

---

### ✓ The problem is urgent and costly

**Evidence the problem is worth solving:**
- [ ] People described it as a "top 3 frustration"
- [ ] They've tried multiple solutions that failed
- [ ] It costs them measurable time/money
- [ ] They're currently using painful workarounds
- [ ] They'd pay to solve it

---

## Phase 2: Solution Validation

### ✓ I have a clear solution hypothesis

**My solution in one sentence:**
_______________________________________________________________

**It solves the problem by:**
_______________________________________________________________

**It's better than current options because:**
_______________________________________________________________

---

### ✓ I understand the competitive landscape

**Current solutions customers use:**

| Solution | Pros (why they use it) | Cons (why they're unhappy) |
|----------|------------------------|----------------------------|
| 1. |  |  |
| 2. |  |  |
| 3. |  |  |

**My differentiation:**
_______________________________________________________________

---

### ✓ I've tested my solution concept (without building it)

**Ways to test before building:**
- [ ] Created a landing page describing the solution (did people sign up?)
- [ ] Showed mockups/wireframes to potential customers (did they get excited?)
- [ ] Offered a manual/concierge version (did they use it?)
- [ ] Ran a small ad campaign (did people click?)

**Results:**
- Sign-ups/interest: _______________
- Feedback: _______________________________________________
- Willingness to pay: _______________________________________________

---

## Phase 3: Market Validation

### ✓ The market is big enough

**Market size estimation:**
- Total potential customers: _______________
- Realistic customers I could reach in Year 1: _______________
- Average revenue per customer: £_______________
- Potential Year 1 revenue: £_______________

**Is this market worth pursuing?**
- [ ] Yes, it's large enough to build a business
- [ ] No, it's too niche
- [ ] Unsure, need more research

---

### ✓ I can reach my target customers

**My distribution channels:**
- [ ] Direct outreach (LinkedIn, email)
- [ ] Content marketing (SEO, blog)
- [ ] Paid advertising (Google, Facebook, LinkedIn)
- [ ] Partnerships/referrals
- [ ] Communities (Reddit, Slack, forums)
- [ ] Events/conferences

**I've tested:**
- [ ] At least 2 channels
- [ ] I know the cost to acquire a customer
- [ ] I have a repeatable process

---

### ✓ The timing is right

**Market timing check:**
- [ ] The problem is growing (not shrinking)
- [ ] Technology/infrastructure exists to build this
- [ ] Customers are ready to adopt (not too early)
- [ ] Competitors haven't saturated the market (not too late)

---

## Phase 4: Business Model Validation

### ✓ I know how I'll make money

**Revenue model:**
- [ ] One-time purchase
- [ ] Subscription (monthly/annual)
- [ ] Freemium
- [ ] Commission/marketplace
- [ ] Advertising
- [ ] Other: _______________

**Pricing:**
- Planned price: £_______________
- Customer willingness to pay (from research): £_______________
- Competitor pricing: £_______________

---

### ✓ The unit economics work

**Basic calculations:**
- Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC): £_______________
- Lifetime Value (LTV): £_______________
- LTV:CAC ratio: _______________

**Rule of thumb:** LTV should be 3x CAC or higher

---

### ✓ I've estimated startup costs

**Costs to build MVP:**
- Development/building: £_______________
- Tools/software: £_______________
- Marketing/testing: £_______________
- **Total:** £_______________

**I can afford this:**
- [ ] Yes, I have the funds
- [ ] I need to raise/save: £_______________
- [ ] I need to find a co-founder to build it

---

## Phase 5: Founder-Market Fit

### ✓ I have relevant expertise or passion

- [ ] I have industry experience in this space
- [ ] I've personally experienced this problem
- [ ] I'm deeply curious about this problem
- [ ] I have a unique insight others don't

---

### ✓ I'm committed for the long haul

- [ ] I'm willing to work on this for 2-3 years minimum
- [ ] I'm prepared for setbacks and failures
- [ ] My life circumstances allow for this commitment
- [ ] I've discussed with family/partner (if applicable)

---

## Final Validation Score

**Count how many sections you've fully completed:**

- [ ] Phase 1: Problem Validation (4 checkpoints)
- [ ] Phase 2: Solution Validation (3 checkpoints)
- [ ] Phase 3: Market Validation (3 checkpoints)
- [ ] Phase 4: Business Model Validation (3 checkpoints)
- [ ] Phase 5: Founder-Market Fit (2 checkpoints)

**Total: _____ / 15**

## Decision Framework

### 13-15: Strong Validation ✅
**→ Proceed with building MVP**
- You've done thorough validation
- Risk is significantly reduced
- Time to build and test with real customers

### 10-12: Moderate Validation ⚠️
**→ Address gaps before building**
- Identify which phases are weak
- Conduct more research/testing
- Strengthen weak areas, then reassess

### 7-9: Weak Validation ⏸️
**→ More validation needed**
- Significant unknowns remain
- Spend more time on customer discovery
- Don't build yet

### Below 7: Not Validated ❌
**→ Pivot or pause**
- Core assumptions aren't validated
- Consider pivoting the idea
- Or pursue validation more rigorously before proceeding

---

## Next Steps Based on Score

### If you're validated (13-15):
1. Build your MVP (simplest version)
2. Get it in front of 10-25 beta users
3. Measure: Are they using it? Coming back?

### If you need more validation (7-12):
1. Focus on your weakest phase
2. Conduct more interviews or tests
3. Revisit this checklist in 2-4 weeks

### If you're not validated (below 7):
1. Decide: pivot the idea or stop?
2. If pivoting: what did you learn?
3. If stopping: extract lessons for next idea

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Skipping customer interviews**
→ Assumptions aren't validation

❌ **Asking "Would you use this?"**
→ Ask about past behaviour, not hypothetical future

❌ **Building before validating**
→ Validation comes first, building second

❌ **Confusing interest with commitment**
→ "Sounds cool" ≠ "I'll pay for this"

❌ **Ignoring negative feedback**
→ Criticism is more valuable than praise
